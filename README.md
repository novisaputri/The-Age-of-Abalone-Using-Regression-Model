# The Age of Abalone Using Regression Model
Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements using regression model in Python

Abalones also called ear shells or sea ears are sea snails found world wide. 

> The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope (a boring and time consuming task). Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

The data is from Kaggle(a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions), you can download it at https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset

# Business Understanding
**PROBLEM** : Only have basic customer data but want to know customer behaviour to plan marketing strategy accordingly.

**QUESTION** : How to understand customer behaviour to plan marketing strategy accordingly?

**MEASURE** : A well clustered customer basen on basic data that we have.
